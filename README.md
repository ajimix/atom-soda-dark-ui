# Atom Soda Dark Theme

A port of the Soda Dark theme for Atom.

As seen with the Base 16 Tomorrow Night color scheme (included with Atom).

Not a 100% port just yet. Still a WIP.

Can be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
